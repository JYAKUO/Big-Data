    "# Bird Sightings!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "By Justin Kuo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of code essentially takes number of times each person spotted that type of bird. Not the number of birds they spotted, but instead the date they sited that type of bird. This data can expose the patterns/habbits of the birds as the seasons come and go. Whether its what type of whether they like, or the living habitats they need, its easy to see in a side by side comparison. Some of data is over several years while others might be just over the span of one year. This is also why some sighting numbers might come out a lot higher than others. Unless specificed however, it is just data from one year. Section two focuses more specifically on how many birds of those type were spotted during each watch. Because some people might not want to count, or are not necessarily sure how many unique birds of that type they saw, they did not give a value. I replaced this value with a relatively common number (in most cases), a one. Seeing the actualy bird count in section two sort of also tells us the commonality of that bird. Comparing it to other bird data you might be able to see the general difference in population, and how rare that bird might be.\n"

    "# Section 1 Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the data for Snowy Owls, its clear that they were most often spotted during the winter. They were spotted the most during the peak of winter during December and January, and started immideatley fading out the moment it hit February and March. Snowy Owl is already a pretty suggestive name and it's not that big of a surprise that they're here mostly during the coldest months in winter. For Annas Hummingbirds, the data shows that they're a year round bird. However, they do tend to be most often spotted nearing and end of winter and into spring from the months January to May. This may suggest that prefer chilly temperatures but not ice cold like the Snowy Owls. After May, they immediately drop in 1/3 of spottings probably due to the hotter temperatures. However, seeing as though the Annas are still spotted year round, it should suggest that even when it does get cold they stay in a warmer shetler and maybe just go out into the open less. Lazuli Buntings on the other hand, seem to prefer the hottest temperatures. They are not a year round bird and seem to only stay rom the months May through August (even August having a tremendous drop in sightings). Also they are not sighted during most of the fall and winter seasons probably because of the temperature drop. Bramblings are only ever spotted from the months February through April (with a significant drop in April). This also suggests they like cold weather but not the coldest of weathers. Black Swifts, like only the two hottest months of the year being June and July. They immediatley started leaving the moment it hit August. Harlequin Ducks are a year round bird but are spotted the most during November through January. I would think that the water might be too cold for the ducks during this time around but I guess the oil secrettions from their feathers are enough to keep them warm. They get spotted a lot lest during Spring, Summer, and Fall.  "

    "# Section 2 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph shows how many of each bird of that type were spotted per watch on average. Its clear that the Lazuli Buntings, Snowy Owls, and Bramblings are the least population dense as bird watchers only see about one of them per watch. Annas HummingBirds also seem pretty rare. Also seeing that the people who go bird watching will spend hours watching birds, seeing just one or two of the birds does seem quite rare. The Harlequin Ducks and Black Swifts on the other hand seem to appear in higher quantity whenever spotted, naybe suggesting they have a higher population density. Although population could be the case for some of these birds, maybe these birds just don't thrive much in the King County. For example, maybe the majority of Bramblings just don't live in King County and prefer some other environment (All hypopthetic). \n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Just from the data in section one, you can see approximately what type of temperatures the different species of birds like. Just having everything layed out and printed, its very easy to compare the different months and spottings pertaining to each of those months. Some of the birds that stay year round also seem to be more adaptable than other birds that only appear for a few months at a time. I say this because that If you were to stay year round, it would mean you would have to endure all the seasons, so obvously they need to be adaptable. For section two I did mention the possiblity for data skew in spottings. Theres a chance that some of these birds just don't like King County and aren't many of them are here. However, that might not necessarily relfect on their populationa as a whole of the species. And of course theres the chance of the human counting error. Its definitley not impossible that some of the bird watchers might've accidently spotted the same bird twice and marked it down as different birds and vice versa. "
